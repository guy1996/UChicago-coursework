# University of Chicago Coursework

## CMSC 22100 - Programming Languages

The overarching topic of CS221 is scientific programming language design. The subtopics surveyed include the lambda calculus, dynamic and static semantics, programming language theorems and proof techniques, machine-assisted proofs, and selections of classic and recent literature in programming languages research. Work completed using SML and Coq.

#### Homeworks:

Includes the implementation of a handful of simple languages (including all necessary machinery to compile to SML). Also includes some automated testing of proofs in Coq and exercises from *Types and Programming Languages*, by Benjamin Pierce. 

## CMSC 23300 - Networks and Distributed Systems

The course focuses on the principles and techniques used in the development of networked and distributed software. Topics include programming with sockets; concurrent programming; data link layer (Ethernet, packet switching, etc.); internet and routing protocols (IP, IPv6, ARP, etc.); end-to-end protocols (UDP, TCP); and other commonly used network protocols and techniques. Projects are completed in C for a UNIX environment.

#### Projects:

2810, 2811, 2812, and 2813) using POSIX sockets and pthreads

- [chiTCP](https://github.com/scarvill91/UChicago-coursework/tree/master/CMSC_23300_Networks_and_Distributed_Systems/chitcp): an implementation of the Transmission Control Protocol

- [simple-router](https://github.com/scarvill91/UChicago-coursework/tree/master/CMSC_23300_Networks_and_Distributed_Systems/simple-router): an implementation of an Internet router using the Mininet network emulator
